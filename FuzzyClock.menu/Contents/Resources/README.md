FuzzyClock
==========

A more human clock for the Mac menubar.

Xcode required for building.

This project borrows significantly from two other projects:

- [RossClock](https://github.com/clehner/RossClock), from which I drew the framework for a NSMenuExtra that updates
as a clock, and the ability to render text onto the menubar.
- [FuzzyClock](https://mschmidt.me/osx/index.html#FuzzyClock), from which I used the logic for the clock.
