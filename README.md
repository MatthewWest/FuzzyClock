FuzzyClock
==========

A more human clock for the Mac menubar.

To install, first open MenuCracker-#.#.dmg and follow the installation instructions for that. Then you should be able to double-click the FuzzyClock.menu file and it will appear in your menu bar.

This project borrows significantly from two other projects:

- [RossClock](https://github.com/clehner/RossClock), from which I drew the framework for a NSMenuExtra that updates
as a clock, and the ability to render text onto the menubar.
- [FuzzyClock](https://mschmidt.me/osx/index.html#FuzzyClock), from which I used the logic for the clock.

Known issues: doesn't work well with Yosemite's dark menubar mode.
